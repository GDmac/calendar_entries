# Calendar_entries #

Output ExpressionEngine entries inside a Codeigniter calendar template
See included example template for an explanation

## Notice

This is an experimental plugin, to be able to use custom fields and 
categories inside a monthly calendar. 

Currently with the calendar archive tag, you have to resort to something
like an embed to fetch custom fields or categories.

It is not a finished product, so feel free to help out.
